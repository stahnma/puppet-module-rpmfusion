This is a *very* simple moduel to set up rpmfusion (http://rpmfusion.org/).


# Usage

include rpmfusion

This will include free and nonfree.


I would have liked to have modelled this after the stahnma/epel repository, but because rpmfusion has 2x the repositories as EPEL, I just didn't have time. I needed something that worked right away because I was trying to solve other problems.

# Validation

Thus far, I have tried this on Fedora 20. I have cases in the params class for Fedora 18+, but haven't tried them out.


# Contributing

You're welcome to help make this module better. I normally take pull requests. If you have one, after you open it, it's great if you mention me on twitter, as github notifications are quite noisy when you oversee 900+ repositories.
